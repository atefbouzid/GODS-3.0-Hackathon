# GODS-3.0-Hackathon üèÜ

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the [GODS-3.0 Hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gods30), a 12-hour coding challenge focused on leveraging artificial intelligence for enhancing workplace safety. Our team DataDemons competed against 65 other teams and secured the 3rd place in the public leaderboard and 4th place in the private leaderboard.

## Hackathon Details
- **Topic**: Detection of Personal Protective Equipment on Construction Sites for Workplace Safety
- **Goal**: The main objective was to develop an automated detection system for personal protective equipment (PPE) in construction site images. This system aims to use AI to identify whether workers are wearing the required safety gear, thereby contributing to improved safety measures on construction sites.
